# Programming Challenges Solutions

😎 Well, hello there. This repository has the *Algorithms* for many coding challenges and code snippets of some code implementations.

I'm making the solution in **Typescript**, **Go** and **Python** so far, but in the future maybe I could add more language to the mix.

**You're welcome to contribute** if you like. Maybe adding a better solution to the existing ones, adding an implementation in another language, fixing an issue, etc. So, don't be afraid to make some modifications.

And, of course, show some love to this repo by adding some 🌟 to it... if you want or if you think this repo deserts it.

Well, that's it for me. I hope that his repo helps you in some way or another. ✌


## Notes
- Many of the problems in here are from **hackerrank** but there are others that I found elsewhere and I decided to put them in here.
